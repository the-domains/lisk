  Counterparty, the technology for decentralized financial tools on the Bitcoin
  blockchain, has started running Ethereum smart contracts by porting the
  Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to its codebase. In late 2014, Counterparty
  added their support to execute the Ethereum smart contracts platform on
  Bitcoin; however, at that time, Ethereum was in its pre-alpha stage of
  development, with its first major release, Frontier, not yet being announced.
