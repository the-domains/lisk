  Kordek: Lisk provides a scalable platform for the biggest developer audience
  in the world; JavaScript coders. At this moment, it's rocket science to
  develop a decentralized, peer-to-peer application. With Lisk, the App SDK, and
  blockchain technology, this becomes very easy. Practically every JavaScript
  developer can now work on decentralized technologies with a very low learning
  curve.
